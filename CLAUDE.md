## Overview

**join-quant** is an automated pipeline for the [JoinQuant](https://www.joinquant.com) Chinese quant platform. It discovers community strategies, clones their source + performance metrics, and runs backtests — both for community posts and for local custom strategy files. Node.js (>=18), Playwright for browser automation, raw HTTP for the API paths.

## Setup & Commands

```bash
npm install          # installs playwright
npm test             # node --test tests/*.test.js

# CLI (see index.js)
node index.js community <postId> <backtestId> [replyId]  # backtest a community post
node index.js custom <path-to-strategy.py>               # backtest a local file
node index.js custom --backtestId <id>                   # re-run existing backtest
node index.js list                                       # list local ./strategies/
node index.js login                                      # force fresh login, cache cookies
node index.js status                                     # show cached cookie status

# Pipeline 1 (discovery/clone) entry points — not wired into index.js
node utils/strategy-discover.js            # crawl community listV2, build queue
node utils/strategy-fetch.js [N]           # process clone queue (optional limit)
node utils/strategy-daily.js               # cron: discover -> clone loop
node utils/strategy-daily.js --discover-only

# Discovery knobs (Pipeline 1)
node utils/strategy-discover.js --pages 20            # walk 20 pages per (cate,type) combo
node utils/strategy-discover.js --pages 50 --limit 50 --cates 3,0
node utils/strategy-discover.js status                # strategy + resource queue status

# Factor library (research input)
node utils/factorlib-ingest.js                        # zz500 / 3y, both cost levels
node utils/factorlib-ingest.js --universe zz1000 --range 1y
node utils/factorlib-ingest.js --list-settings        # legal universe/range/fee values
```

### Chrome / auth setup (required for Pipeline 2)

Pipeline 2 connects to an already-logged-in Chrome over CDP to inherit `httpOnly`
session cookies and bypass JoinQuant's CAPTCHA. **Where that Chrome runs is
configurable** — `config/exec.env` (gitignored; template at `config/exec.env.example`):

```bash
JQ_EXEC_MODE=local     # or: remote
```

**local mode** — Chrome on this machine. Start it once and keep it running:

```bash
nohup /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome \
  --remote-debugging-port=9225 \
  --user-data-dir=/tmp/jq-auth-browser \
  > /tmp/chrome-jq.log 2>&1 &
# First run: log into joinquant.com manually. Closing Chrome invalidates the session.
```

**remote mode** — Chrome runs on the Windows QMT server (see the `QMT-server` repo).
Its debug port is bound to the server's `127.0.0.1`, so an **SSH tunnel** bridges it:

```
localhost:9225  ->  ssh  ->  server 127.0.0.1:9225
```

The tunnel opens **automatically** — `utils/exec-config.js` probes the CDP endpoint on
every entry point and runs `scripts/cdp-tunnel.sh up` if nothing answers. Manual control:

```bash
./scripts/cdp-tunnel.sh up|down|status
```

Because the tunnel presents the browser at `localhost:9225`, every existing
`connectOverCDP('http://localhost:9225')` call works unchanged in both modes. This
also keeps Chrome's Host-header check happy (it rejects non-localhost `Host` values)
and avoids exposing the debug port — CDP on a logged-in brokerage session is a full
remote-control channel and must never be opened to the network.

In **remote mode the local-browser fallback is disabled**: the logged-in session lives
in the server's Chrome profile, so launching a browser on the Mac would only hit the
login page + CAPTCHA. `strategy-post-backtest.js` fails loudly instead.

Environment variables (optional — CDP path needs no credentials):
`JOINQUANT_USERNAME`, `JOINQUANT_PASSWORD`. `JQ_CDP_URL` still overrides the resolved
URL outright; `JQ_EXEC_MODE`, `JQ_CDP_PORT`, `JQ_REMOTE_SSH_HOST`, `JQ_REMOTE_SSH_OPTS`,
`JQ_REMOTE_CDP_PORT` override `config/exec.env` per-invocation.

## Two Pipelines

**Pipeline 1 — Daily Discovery & Clone** (`pipelines/community.js`, `utils/strategy-*.js`):
`GET /community/post/listV2` (paginated) lists community posts → split into **strategies**
(32-char `backtestId`) and **resources** (Jupyter `notebookPath`, `fileKey` attachment, or a
研报分享 / 研报复现 / 研究 tag) → dedupe against `data/discovered.json` + `data/resources.json`
→ for each strategy: `GET /algorithm/backtest/source` (Python source) +
`POST /algorithm/backtest/stats` (metrics) → save `.py` to `strategies/` → WeChat alert.
Both queues ranked by composite score (strategies: `likes + clones × 0.5`).

> ⚠ **All HTTP goes through `utils/jq-http.js`, never raw `https.get`/`curl`.** JoinQuant
> geo-blocks requests from outside mainland China with an **HTTP 200 HTML** page
> (「当前地区暂不支持访问」), so a raw call parses as a JSON error and older code read that
> as "no results" — Pipeline 1 died silently this way for two months. `jq-http` runs
> `fetch()` **inside the CDP Chrome** (right region + logged-in cookies), falls back to
> direct https only when CDP is down, and **throws** `GeoBlockedError` rather than
> returning an empty list. Never reintroduce a direct HTTP call to joinquant.com.

`listV2` pagination is deep: `page=800` at `limit=50` still returns a full page, reaching
back to 2019. Use `--pages N`; the crawler stops a combo early on the first page that adds
nothing new.

**Pipeline 2 — Custom Strategy Backtest** (`pipelines/custom.js`, `backtest/runner.js`):
Browser-automated via CDP. Create `algorithmId` → inject Python into JQ's **Ace editor**
(`window.ace.edit(div).setValue(...)`, also synced to hidden `<textarea id="code">` which
the backend reads on save) → click 保存 / 编译运行 → **reload-poll** the buildList every 5s
for `完成` → scrape the result table for return/drawdown/Alpha/Beta/Sharpe.

> Why CDP, not a Playwright launch? JQ stores `PHPSESSID`/`token` as `httpOnly` cookies that
> Playwright can't set, and headless browsers hit the 拼图验证 CAPTCHA. CDP reuses the real session.
> Why reload-polling? JQ mutates backtest status in-place via XHR; a static `goto` misses updates.

## Layout

Only the directories whose contents aren't self-evident:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `harness/` | **Shared frozen backtest台**: `harness.md` (window/cost/OOS protocol, read-only) + `normalize-*.tsv` ledgers (gitignored). Used by study + enhance + future research. |
| `enhance/` | Auto-**enhance** team (optimize a strategy FAMILY): `program.md`, `candidates/`, `strategy_template.py`, transient `ideas-queue.json`/`loop-state.json`/`results.tsv` (gitignored) |
| `study/` | Auto-study team (understand a strategy FAMILY): `program.md`, `<family>/baseline.py` + `variants/`, transient `questions.json`/`findings.tsv` (gitignored). Writes back to `wiki/families/`. |
| `research/` | Reserved for a future auto-**research** pipeline — broad context: new data / factors / trading ideas. NOT the current optimize loop (that is `enhance/`). Holds `factorlib/` (below). |
| `research/factorlib/` | JQ **因子看板** ingested by `utils/factorlib-ingest.js`: 285 factors with formulas, IC/IR, quintile returns and turnover, pulled at **both** cost levels. `factors.tsv` + generated `README.md` (tracked); raw payloads in `data/factorlib/`. |
| `validated_strategies/` | Finalized strategies that completed VAL (Agent 4 archives here; **tracked** = product shelf) |
| `data/` | **Tracked** (private backup) — discovery + resource state, `factorlib/` raw payloads. Only `data/cookies.json` is gitignored. |
| `auth/` | Session cookies; `auth/cookies.json` itself is **gitignored** (default cookie path). |

## Notes & Gotchas

- `data/` and `auth/` are **tracked** (private backup); only `data/cookies.json` and
  `auth/cookies.json` are gitignored. Never commit a cookie file.
- Default cookie path in `index.js` is `auth/cookies.json`.
- **Never call joinquant.com with raw `https`/`curl`** — use `utils/jq-http.js`. See the
  geo-block note under Pipeline 1.
- The factor dashboard's `factor_id` is **regenerated per request**: the same factor comes
  back under a different id on every call. Join factor rows on `name`, never on `factor_id`.
- The factor dashboard defaults to `commisionFee=0` (no costs), the same blind spot as
  `harness.md` §2. At `commisionFee=18` only **6 of 285** factors keep a positive excess
  annual return, down from 23 — and every survivor is low-turnover.
- Pipeline 2's backtest window is parameterized via `--window train|val` (or `--start/--end`),
  set through the `newStrategy` URL params. The **2025+ OOS window is hard-blocked** (`OOS-BLOCKED`)
  unless `JQ_ALLOW_OOS=1` — see `harness/harness.md`. No flag = JQ default range (ad-hoc).
- Do not close the CDP Chrome process — it invalidates the JQ session and forces re-login.
